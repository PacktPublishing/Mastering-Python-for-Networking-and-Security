**Leverage Python scripts and libraries to overcome networking and security issues
**

## What is this book about?
It’s becoming more and more apparent that security is a critical aspect of IT infrastructure. A data breach is a major security incident, usually carried out by just hacking a simple network line. Increasing your network’s security helps step up your defenses against cyber attacks. Meanwhile, Python is being used for increasingly advanced tasks, with the latest update introducing many new packages. This book focuses on leveraging these updated packages to build a secure network with the help of Python scripting.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Develop Python scripts for automating security and pentesting tasks 
Discover the Python standard library's main modules used for performing security-related tasks 
Automate analytical tasks and the extraction of information from servers 
Explore processes for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities in servers 
Use network software for Python programming 
Perform server scripting and port scanning with Python 
Identify vulnerabilities in web applications with Python 
Use Python to extract metadata and forensics

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import requests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    response = requests.get("http://www.python.org")
    for header in response.headers.keys():
        print(header  + ":" + response.headers[header])

```
